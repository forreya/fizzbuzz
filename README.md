# Fizzbuzz

The first pair programming exercise from the pre-course of Makers academy.

## What the program does:

- The program can be passed a number.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.
- When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'FizzBuzz'.
- In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.

## How to run tests:

1. Clone this repository onto your computer.
2. Type `rspec` in terminal after opening the program.
